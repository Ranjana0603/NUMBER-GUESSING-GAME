A Number Guessing Game is a simple interactive game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a given range. 
The game provides hints like "Too high" or "Too low" after each incorrect guess, helping the player narrow down the correct number.
To implement it in Python, you can use the random module to generate a secret number.
The player inputs guesses in a loop until they find the correct answer. 
The game can also include features like limited attempts, a difficulty selection, or even a score system based on the number of tries.
This game helps beginners understand loops, conditionals, and user input handling in programming.
